# Interactive Cologne 2014 Hackathon Project - Staring Contest

Who stares longest, survives!

It's an game where you have to keep your eyes open in order to not get eaten by the ghost known from Super Mario World (SNES).

## Installation notes

* Run ``npm install`` and ``bower install``
* An server is served when you run ``gulp``

## Third party stuff

To track the eyes we currently use JSFeat script from Eugene Zatepyakin (https://github.com/inspirit/jsfeat).
Due to critical performance loss we switched from tracking.js (https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js).
