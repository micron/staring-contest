It's an game where you have to keep your eyes open in order to not get eaten by the ghost known from Super Mario World (SNES).

## Installation notes

* Run ``npm install`` and ``bower install``
* An server is served when you run ``gulp``

## Third party stuff

To track the eyes we currently use the tracking.js script from Eduardo Lundgren (https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js)
